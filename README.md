# Driver Drowsiness Detection

This project is a **real-time driver drowsiness detection system** using computer vision and eye aspect ratio (EAR) analysis.  
It uses **OpenCV**, **MediaPipe**, and **NumPy** to track facial landmarks, calculate PERCLOS (Percentage of Eye Closure), and trigger alerts when the driver is likely drowsy.
